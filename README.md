#### This repository is used to update DDNS in Cloudflare gateway with GitHub Actions. The following secrets are needed to run the actions:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`: a99a6639106339672c19b330663b9c828867d
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: bc262949ac77aa7fd359fe7e600905a5
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: thanhdat5639@gmail.com
- `CLOUDFLARE_LOCATION_ID`: 560fe68e52494805baf908383ce0a6c8
- `CLOUDFLARE_LOCATION_NAME`: DT
- `DDNS_HOSTNAME`: datthanh

#### By default, I set the action to run as a crontab every hour, but you can change it by yourself.
